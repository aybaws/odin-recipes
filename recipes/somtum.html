    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Som Tum, also known as green papaya salad, is a spicy and tangy Thai
      salad. It is made with shredded unripe papaya, tomatoes, green beans,
      peanuts, and sometimes shrimp or salted crab. The salad is typically
      dressed with a mixture of lime juice, fish sauce, palm sugar, and chili
      peppers. The flavors of Som Tum are a balance of sour, spicy, salty, and
      slightly sweet. It is often enjoyed as a refreshing and zesty appetizer or
      side dish.
