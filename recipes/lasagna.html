    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with stacked layers of pasta
      sheets, meat sauce, cheese, and often, additional ingredients like
      vegetables or mushrooms. The pasta sheets are typically layered with a
      meaty tomato sauce (bolognese), ricotta or béchamel sauce, and a variety
      of cheeses such as mozzarella and Parmesan. The layers are baked until the
      cheese is melted and bubbly, creating a rich and comforting casserole.
      Lasagna is a hearty and satisfying dish that is enjoyed by many around the
      world.
